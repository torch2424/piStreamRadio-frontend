  "description": "piStreamRadio is run out of an apartment in Southern California. We're two dudes with similar and different tastes in music, and wanted to open up our own 24/7 live radio. We wanted to share some of our favorite hip hop, chill hop, jazz hop, indie, rock, punk, rap, alternative, vaporwave, and future funk tracks for people to tune in to. We're maintaining this stream so we have something cool to listen to while we drive around town, study, and just chill at home, and thought to share it with everyone else. We want to share awesome tracks from a variety of artists, while trying to keep the good vibes. Since we are close to the beach, this is something we like to be represented in the stream. And we hope that you enjoy!"
